TODO:
    - make so after selecting tasks, it will calculate algorithnm and put it in list
    every time button is pressed, it will go forward to backward, coloring lines and visited
    node
    - optimize code
    - sometimes when drawing only one line node is being connected to multiple nodes
    - update updateLineOnDrag()
    - line color doesnt work
    - make so minimal drawing panel will be limited by nodes on the edge,
    so script will add scroller for user
    - borders


    Not important:
        - make letter more "in the middle"
        - ability to delete lines 
        - window with credits
        - add checkbox to save settings

Will not be implemented due lack of time and motivation:
    - animation for when node is being dragged
    - ability to input data by a table
    - all nodes should have own z level, and on press it should bring it on top
    - more names for nodes
    - ability to connect node with itself and visually show it
    - ability to show two nodes with multiple connections
    - add notes of errors when user didn't do something
    - add a crown when node is selected in Tasks
